		<h3>Purposes and legal basis of the processing operation</h3>
		
		<h4>Purposes of the processing operation</h4>
		<p>“EPstairs Web app” is a mobile application which displays the number of steps that a user takes. To count his or her activity (number of steps), the user has to scan QR codes when he or she is entering and exiting the stairways. Those QR codes are posted near some stairway entrances in the EU buildings.</p>
		<p>Each user can see his or her record list of activities related to a given period. Rankings of the ten best climbers, calculated on a weekly basis and also your overall steps, are shared with all users of the application. In order to encourage participants, prizes could be awarded for the best climbers based on their rankings per category. Different categories could be used such as the status and gender of users.</p>
		<h4>Legal basis for processing personal data</h4>
		<p>The application is compliant with the Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 for the processing of personal data carried out by the European Parliament. The legal basis for the processing operations is the Article 5(a), Article 5(d) and Recital 27 of the Regulation (EC) No 45/2001.</p>

		<h3>Data subjects rights</h3>
		<h4>How may the data subjects exercise their rights?</h4>
		<p>The data controller for the processing operation described above is [FIRST NAME   LAST NAME], the [STATUS OF THE DATA CONTROLLER]. The data subjects may exercise the following rights by contacting the relevant actors as explained in the next paragraphs.</p>

		<h4>Right to withdraw consent</h4>
